# 404Deals

A modern, responsive Black Friday sales landing page built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates both good automation testing practices and intentional accessibility issues for educational purposes.

## Accessibility issues Issues (Intentional)

These accessibility issues are intentionally included for educational testing:

1. **Missing Alt Text**: Product images missing descriptive alt attributes
2. **Form Label**: Order ID field lacks proper label association
3. **Color Contrast**: Some secondary text has low contrast ratios
4. **Focus Indicators**: Certain interactive elements lack focus styles

**Note**: This is a demonstration website created for testing and educational purposes. No actual products are sold, and no real transactions are processed.
